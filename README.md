# eaw.modinfo Definition - v1.0.1

A standard definition for Star Wars: Empire at War mod info files.

The info files defined herein allow mod makers and tool makers to specify metainformation about a given Empire at War mod.

## Filename

The metainformation has to be saved in a `JSON` file called `modinfo.json`.

## File Position

The `modinfo.json` has to be located at the top level of the mod folder next to the `data` folder.

## File Content

The following sections specify the required and optional content for `eaw.modinfo` in Version 1.0.0.

### Exemplary Content

```json
{
  "name": "The mod's name",

    ]
  },
  "custom":{
    "my_custom_key": "My important additional value."
  }
}
```

### The `"name"` Tag [REQUIRED]

This tag specifies the fully qualified mod name, e.g. "Republic at War", "Thrawn's Revenge: Imperial Civil War", "Awakening of the Rebellion" or "Yuuzhan Vong at War"

### The `"summary"` Tag [OPTIONAL]

This tag allows you to include a short summary about the mod supporting Steam-flavoured BBCode.

### The `"icon"` Tag [OPTIONAL]

The relative path to the mod's icon file.

### The `"version"` Tag [OPTIONAL]

The mod's version according to the extended semantic versioning: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) that also supports a fourth digits for build increments, etc. and suffixes (e.g. `"-rc1"`).

### The `"steamdata"` Tag [OPTIONAL]

The `steamdata` container holds additional info that is required for the Steam Version of the game.
The container is either absent from the `modinfo.json` or it is fully required.

#### The `"steamdata.publishedfileid"` Tag

The Steam Workshop ID.

#### The `"steamdata.contentfolder"` Tag

The content folder's name as specified by the Steam Uploader.

#### The `"steamdata.visibility"` Tag

The visibility enumeration:

| Value | Meaning |
|:--:|:--|
|0|hidden|
|1|friends only|
|2|public|


#### The `"steamdata.metadata"` Tag

Arbitrary metadata as string.

#### The `"steamdata.tags"` Tag

Steam Tags as specified by the Steam Uploader.

At least either `EAW` or `FOC` is required to determine the game the mod shows up for.

### The `"custom"` Tag [OPTIONAL]

The `custom` tag allows arbitrary extensions to the format. Programs implementing the core format should always be able to serialize the whole object, but the custom data wrapped within the extension object has to be accounted for only where applicable and/or needed.
